DevNews
---

A technology-focused community website for sharing interesting news online.

This repository holds the source code of the Android app for [DevNews](https://github.com/emdemir/devnews).

## Dependencies

Gradle should be enough, however I haven't tested building this outside of Android Studio. If you
have any problems, feel free to open an issue.

## Building

It should build normally in Android Studio.
